## Clean Up Orphaned Docker Volumes

### Purpose:
This tool is created to periodically remove orphaned volumes where the contents are not going to need future retrieval. In some environments where containers are treated ephemerally and  have high turnover there is the potential to generate a lot of space consuming orphaned volumes. It is VERY difficult to track down the origin of a particular volume once the container it was attached to is gone.

### Quick Usage

```
docker run -d --privileged -v /var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock cloudnautique/vol-cleanup [-n] -i 5
```

If you run with `-n` it will log what it would delete.

### Building

To generate a statically linked (Linux) go binary

```$ ./scripts/build```

It will be placed in the `./dist` directory.

### Packaging into a container

To generate a small Busybox container with the binary installed run:

`$ IMAGE=<username>/vol-cleanup ./scripts/package`

The default command of the image is to display the help page. Figured it was safer then starting to clean up files.
